# Note-Maker
The Note Taking Web App is a simple web application that allows users to create, edit, and delete notes. The app is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it leverages the Web Storage API to store notes locally in the user's browser. Each note is represented as a text area where users can input and modify their content. The app also incorporates a feature that prompts users for confirmation before deleting a note, preventing accidental deletions.
